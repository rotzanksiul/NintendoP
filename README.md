# VideoGamePage
This is a full reponsive nintendo inspired page.
I like very much this nintendo design, so I took that inspiration from the nintendo main page and wanted to make my own and use all the skills 
I learned after creating multiple pages. I tried to be really organized as posible using pure basic code since this is a full HTML, CSS and Javascript 
Project and I added some details like non nintendo games and also adding some of my ideas and this is the result. The page is full responsive so I added some details when I changes to screen sizes.
