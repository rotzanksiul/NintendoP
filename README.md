# VideoGamePage
This is a full reponsive nintendo inspired page.
I like very much this nintendo page design, so I took that inspiration from the nintendo main page and wanted to make my own and use all the skills 
I learned after creating multiple pages. I tried to be really organized as posible since this is a full HTML, CSS and Javascript Project and I added
some details like non nintendo games and also adding some of my ideas and this is the result.
