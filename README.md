# VideoGamePage
This is a fully responsive Nintendo-inspired page.
I like very much this Nintendo design, so I took that inspiration from the Nintendo main page and wanted to make my own and use all the skills 
I learned this after creating multiple pages. I tried to be really organized as possible using pure basic code since this is a full HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
Project and I added some details like nonnintendo games and also added some of my ideas and this is the result. I added some details when I changed to screen sizes.

Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
